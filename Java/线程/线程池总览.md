## ```Executor```

An object that executes submitted ```Runnable``` tasks. This interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread use, scheduling, etc. An Executor is normally used instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than invoking ```new Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start()``` for each of a set of tasks, you might use:
 ```java
 Executor executor = anExecutor;
 executor.execute(new RunnableTask1());
 executor.execute(new RunnableTask2());
 // ...
 ```
 
 ## ```ExecutorService``` 
 
 ```public interface ExecutorService extends Executor```
 
An ```Executor``` that provides methods to manage termination and methods that can produce a Future for tracking progress of one or more asynchronous tasks.

An ```ExecutorService``` can be shut down, which will cause it to reject new tasks. Two different methods are provided for shutting down an ```ExecutorService```. The ```shutdown()``` method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before terminating, while the ```shutdownNow()``` method prevents waiting tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks. Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted. An unused ExecutorService should be shut down to allow reclamation of its resources.

Method submit extends base method ```Executor.execute(Runnable)``` by creating and returning a Future that can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion. Methods ```invokeAny``` and ```invokeAll``` perform the most commonly useful forms of bulk execution, executing a collection of tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to complete. (Class ```ExecutorCompletionService``` can be used to write customized variants of these methods.)

## ```AbstractExecutorService``` 

```public abstract class AbstractExecutorService extends Object implements ExecutorService```

Provides default implementations of ```ExecutorService``` execution methods. This class implements the ```submit```, ```invokeAny``` and ```invokeAll``` methods using a ```RunnableFuture``` returned by newTaskFor, which defaults to the ```FutureTask``` class provided in this package. For example, the implementation of ```submit(Runnable)``` creates an associated ```RunnableFuture``` that is executed and returned. Subclasses may override the ```newTaskFor``` methods to return ```RunnableFuture``` implementations other than FutureTask.

## ```ThreadPoolExecutor``` 

```public class ThreadPoolExecutor extends AbstractExecutorService```

An ```ExecutorService``` that executes each submitted task using one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured using Executors factory methods.
Thread pools address two different problems: they usually provide improved performance when executing large numbers of asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead, and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources, including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks. Each ```ThreadPoolExecutor``` also maintains some basic statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.

To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient Executors factory methods ```Executors.newCachedThreadPool()``` (unbounded thread pool, with automatic thread reclamation), ```Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int)``` (fixed size thread pool) and ```Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()``` (single background thread), that preconfigure settings for the most common usage scenarios.

## ```ScheduledExecutorService```

```public interface ScheduledExecutorService extends ExecutorService```

An ```ExecutorService``` that can schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically.
The schedule methods create tasks with various delays and return a task object that can be used to cancel or check execution. The ```scheduleAtFixedRate``` and ```scheduleWithFixedDelay``` methods create and execute tasks that run periodically until cancelled.

Commands submitted using the ```Executor.execute(java.lang.Runnable)``` and ```ExecutorService``` submit methods are scheduled with a requested delay of zero. Zero and negative delays (but not periods) are also allowed in schedule methods, and are treated as requests for immediate execution.

All schedule methods accept relative delays and periods as arguments, not absolute times or dates. It is a simple matter to transform an absolute time represented as a Date to the required form. For example, to schedule at a certain future date, you can use: ```schedule(task, date.getTime() - System.currentTimeMillis(), TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)```. Beware however that expiration of a relative delay need not coincide with the current Date at which the task is enabled due to network time synchronization protocols, clock drift, or other factors. The ```Executors``` class provides convenient factory methods for the ```ScheduledExecutorService``` implementations provided in this package.

## ```ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor```

```public class ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor implements ScheduledExecutorService```

A ```ThreadPoolExecutor``` that can additionally schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically. This class is preferable to Timer when multiple worker threads are needed, or when the additional flexibility or capabilities of ```ThreadPoolExecutor``` (which this class extends) are required.
Delayed tasks execute no sooner than they are enabled, but without any real-time guarantees about when, after they are enabled, they will commence. Tasks scheduled for exactly the same execution time are enabled in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order of submission.

When a submitted task is cancelled before it is run, execution is suppressed. By default, such a cancelled task is not automatically removed from the work queue until its delay elapses. While this enables further inspection and monitoring, it may also cause unbounded retention of cancelled tasks. To avoid this, set ```setRemoveOnCancelPolicy(boolean)``` to true, which causes tasks to be immediately removed from the work queue at time of cancellation.

Successive executions of a task scheduled via ```scheduleAtFixedRate``` or ```scheduleWithFixedDelay``` do not overlap. While different executions may be performed by different threads, the effects of prior executions happen-before those of subsequent ones.

While this class inherits from ```ThreadPoolExecutor```, a few of the inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In particular, because it acts as a fixed-sized pool using corePoolSize threads and an unbounded queue, adjustments to maximumPoolSize have no useful effect. Additionally, it is almost never a good idea to set corePoolSize to zero or use ```allowCoreThreadTimeOut``` because this may leave the pool without threads to handle tasks once they become eligible to run.

**Extension notes:** This class overrides the execute and submit methods to generate internal ```ScheduledFuture``` objects to control per-task delays and scheduling. To preserve functionality, any further overrides of these methods in subclasses must invoke superclass versions, which effectively disables additional task customization. However, this class provides alternative protected extension method decorateTask (one version each for ```Runnable``` and ```Callable```) that can be used to customize the concrete task types used to execute commands entered via ```execute, submit, schedule, scheduleAtFixedRate, and scheduleWithFixedDelay```. By default, a ```ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor``` uses a task type extending ```FutureTask```. However, this may be modified or replaced using subclasses of the form:

```java
public class CustomScheduledExecutor extends ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor {

   static class CustomTask<V> implements RunnableScheduledFuture<V> { ... }

   protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(
                Runnable r, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {
       return new CustomTask<V>(r, task);
   }

   protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(
                Callable<V> c, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {
       return new CustomTask<V>(c, task);
   }
   // ... add constructors, etc.
 }
```

## Executors

Factory and utility methods for ```Executor```, ```ExecutorService```, ```ScheduledExecutorService```, ```ThreadFactory```, and ```Callable``` classes defined in this package. This class supports the following kinds of methods:
* Methods that create and return an ```ExecutorService``` set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
* Methods that create and return a ```ScheduledExecutorService``` set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
* Methods that create and return a "wrapped" ```ExecutorService```, that disables reconfiguration by making implementation-specific methods inaccessible.
* Methods that create and return a ```ThreadFactory``` that sets newly created threads to a known state.
* Methods that create and return a ```Callable``` out of other closure-like forms, so they can be used in execution methods requiring ```Callable```.
